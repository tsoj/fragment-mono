# Fragment Mono including Bold

Fragment Mono is a monospaced coding version of Helvetica created by modifying and extending [Nimbus Sans](https://github.com/twardoch/urw-core35-fonts) by URW Design Studio. 
This fork only adds a bold variant using fontforge.

## Building

Fonts are built automatically by GitHub Actions - take a look in the "Actions" tab for the latest build.

If you want to build fonts manually on your own computer:

* `make build` will produce font files.
* `make test` will run [FontBakery](https://github.com/googlefonts/fontbakery)'s quality assurance tests.
* `make proof` will generate HTML proof files.

The proof files and QA tests are also available automatically via GitHub Actions - look at https://weiweihuanghuang.github.io/fragment-mono.
